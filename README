The tool runs as a daemon, listening to swift statsd events, writing them out
as rolling counters to /var/log/swift/swift-stats and unless disabled, forwards
them on to the port specified in /etc/swift-stats.conf.  The accompanying tool
swiftstat reads those stats and reports them interactively.

Dependencies:

statsd logging must be enabled in appropriate swift conf file(s).  See
http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/admin_guide.html

Installation:

sudo python setup.py install

Documentation:

see manpages for swift-statstee and swiftstat
